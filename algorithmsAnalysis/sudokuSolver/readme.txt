 Currently this code does 400 iterations for n=3 and k=52. I have enterd all the configurations manually.
 Please see lines 135 to 160 if you want to change inputs. I didn't create a general pattern because n=3 and n=4 had different requirements.
 The graph will be generated in ' C Drive ' as "chart.jpg"
